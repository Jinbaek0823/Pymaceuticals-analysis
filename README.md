1. Correlation Between Mouse Weight and Tumor Volume in Capomulin Treatment:
There is a positive correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume for mice treated with the Capomulin regimen.
This suggests that heavier mice tend to have larger tumor volumes on average when treated with Capomulin.

2. Effectiveness of Different Drug Regimens:
Based on the summary statistics, it appears that Capomulin and Ramicane are more effective in reducing tumor volume compared to Infubinol and Ceftamin.
Capomulin and Ramicane show lower mean and median tumor volumes, indicating better performance in tumor reduction.

3.Gender Distribution:
The pie charts of gender distribution indicate a fairly balanced distribution between male and female mice in the study.
This balance helps ensure that the results of the drug efficacy are not biased by gender differences.
